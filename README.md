                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Theory of Computer Science (CSC504) is a core subject in the Third Year (Semester V) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. This course provides foundational knowledge of computation theory, formal languages, automata, and the theoretical limits of computing.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Theoretical Computer Science:

- **Set Theory & Mathematical Foundations**: Sets, Relations, Functions, Proof Techniques
- **Formal Languages**: Regular Languages, Context-Free Languages, Grammar Classifications
- **Automata Theory**: Finite Automata (DFA, NFA), Pushdown Automata, Turing Machines
- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern Matching, Equivalence with Finite Automata
- **Context-Free Grammars**: Parse Trees, Ambiguity, Chomsky Normal Form
- **Computability Theory**: Decidability, Undecidability, Halting Problem

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, assignments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding theoretical foundations of computation is crucial for compiler design, algorithm analysis, and understanding computational limits. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental TCS concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Theory of Computer Science.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
